# Migrations

`/handoff update` works by comparing structure. It reads each file in `templates/`,
reads the project's corresponding file, and compares section headings, marker lines
and file presence. Anything the template carries and the project lacks is a feature
the project has not adopted yet.

That comparison stays correct without anybody maintaining it, because the templates
are the specification. Editing a template updates the check.

This file exists for the changes that comparison cannot see: a changed default, a
reordered reading list, a rewritten table, a rule whose wording matters. Most releases
add nothing here. Add a block only when you have asked yourself whether the heading
comparison would catch the change and the answer is no.

Human-facing release notes belong in the GitHub release, not here. Write these blocks
as instructions to an agent.

Format: one block per version, newest first. An agent reads only the blocks above the
version recorded in the project's AGENTS.md.

## 3.1 (2026-09-19)

**Chat naming is new.** AGENTS.md gains a `## Naming the chat` section holding a
`Chat prefix:` line. Ask the owner for a short project name, two words at most, and
write it there. The rule: name the chat as the session opens, rename it once when the
real subject is clear, then never again for the life of that chat. Where the platform
cannot set a title, the agent prints the name instead, on those same two occasions.

Why: every chat arrived called something like "handoff continuation", and a list of
forty of them was unusable. Naming twice and no more is the owner's own constraint: a
title that keeps moving is worse than a stale one, because he memorises a name, comes
back for it, and finds it gone. A chat covering three subjects keeps its second name.

## 3.0 (2026-09-19)

Three removals and one addition. This is the first release that takes things away, so
read all four points before presenting a plan.

**VOICE.md is gone from the system.** Delete the file from the project root and delete
the `## Voice` section from AGENTS.md. In its place the AGENTS.md template carries a
`## Writing` section holding one instruction: write plainly, short sentences, no jargon,
no term the owner has not used first.

Ask the owner before deleting their VOICE.md. Some of them wrote their own rules into
it and will want the text back, so show them the file and offer to move it somewhere the
system does not manage. Never delete it silently.

**Learning mode is on or off.** The `Learning mode:` line takes `on` or `off` in place
of `0`, `1` and `2`. A project recorded as `2` or `1` becomes `on`. A project recorded
as `0` becomes `off`. Level 2 no longer exists: an agent asks the owner nothing at the
close of a finished item. Ask during the work instead, when an answer would change what
gets built.

**The explanation moved into current-state.md.** The per-item explainer file is gone.
Add a `## What just changed and why` section to current-state.md, above
`## Limits and unresolved observations`. When an item is finished and learning mode is
on, rewrite that section in full so it explains that item to the owner, then say in one
sentence that it is there. It holds the most recent item and nothing before it.

Remove the `Explainer:` line from the queue's task block in improvement-plan.md, and
remove the paragraph telling an agent to replace it. Leave `Explainer:` lines already
written under finished tasks: they point at real files and are part of the record.

An existing `learning/` directory is the owner's history. Leave every file in it exactly
as it is, leave it out of the reading order, and tell the owner the system no longer
writes there. Do not migrate old explainers into current-state.md; that section holds one
item and merging years of them into it would defeat the change.

`templates/.gitignore.template` no longer ignores `learning/` or `VOICE.md`. A project
whose own .gitignore lists them can keep those lines, because the files may still exist.

**Reporting rules are new and they bind.** AGENTS.md gains a `## Reporting to the owner`
section, and the same rules sit in SKILL.md so they apply in a project set up before 3.0.
Report what someone can now do that they should not be able to do, or what the owner can
now do that they could not before. Six lines opens a session. No file paths, function
names or queue identifiers unless the owner asks or has to open something themselves.

Why all four: the owner of this project ran 2.x on real work for four days. He did not
read the explainer files, described the level 2 questions as a tax, and could not read a
session opener that was correct and dense. Each removal here is a feature that measured
worse than nothing.

## 2.9 (2026-09-15)

`/handoff update` now updates the kit before it updates the project. It fetches the
published `VERSION` over https, reports both numbers, shows the reinstall command and
waits for the owner. A failed fetch is reported as a failed check and never as proof the
kit is current.

It also handles a project recorded at a version newer than the installed kit, which it
previously had no rule for. It stops rather than downgrade. Where the project folder
itself holds `templates/` and `MIGRATIONS.md`, that project is the kit's own source and
is meant to run ahead, so the command says so and stops.

The README's Updating section was wrong: it told people to pull a copy of the repository,
which almost nobody has. It now covers `npx skills update -g` and how to check an install.

No project file changes.

---

## 2.8 (2026-09-15)

Nothing in a project changes. Everyone must reinstall.

Until now `install.sh` copied only `SKILL.md`, so Claude Code users got a skill with no
`VERSION`, no `templates/` and no `MIGRATIONS.md`. Every command that needs those failed
outside the kit's own folder. `SKILL.md` also referred to "the starter folder" without
ever saying where it was.

`SKILL.md` now opens by distinguishing the kit from the project and resolves the kit as
the directory holding itself, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` in Claude Code. `install.sh` copies
the whole directory.

Tell the owner to run `npx skills add adamalshoomary-ctrl/shotgun` again, or
`sh install.sh` from a fresh clone. An agent whose kit directory holds only `SKILL.md`
must say so and stop rather than searching the disk.

---

## 2.7 (2026-09-15)

Distribution only. The repository gained `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, so Claude Code users can install it with
`/plugin marketplace add adamalshoomary-ctrl/shotgun` and find it in the Discover tab.

`skills/handoff/SKILL.md` is a symlink to the root `SKILL.md`, which the plugin format
requires and the `npx skills` resolver does not. One real file, two paths to it, so
neither copy can drift from the other.

No project file changes, and nothing about the skill's behaviour changed.

---

## 2.6 (2026-09-15)

`project-context/LEARNING.md` must be replaced with the starter's copy. The level 2
question rules were rewritten after the questions failed on this project's own owner,
who could not follow them.

The old file said only to ask about judgement and consequence. The new one adds three
rules: ask about something the owner watched happen in the session, use the words used
at the time, and make the answer matter to them. It carries a worked pair showing the
same question asked badly and well, and it tells the agent what to do when the owner
cannot follow a question, which is to answer it themselves and log the cause.

No other project file changes.

---

## 2.5 (2026-09-15)

`SKILL.md` moved to the repository root so `npx skills add adamalshoomary-ctrl/shotgun`
resolves it. Nothing about the skill's content changed, and an existing install keeps
working. No project file changes.

---

## 2.4 (2026-09-15)

The skill moved from `.claude/skills/handoff/` to `skill/handoff/` in the repository,
and `install.sh` now copies it into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/` so
Claude Code, Codex and the other Agent Skills adopters all find it. Tell the owner to
run the installer once and restart their agent. Any old copy under a project's
`.claude/skills/handoff/` can be deleted; the installed personal copy replaces it.

The skill body no longer depends on `$0` substitution, which only Claude Code performs.
No project file changes.

---

## 2.3 (2026-09-15)

`project-context/ORCHESTRATION.md` was restructured and must be replaced with the
starter's copy. The old file mixed two decisions in one table: which agent and model
the owner opens, and which model an agent requests for a subagent. An agent reading
the old table could take a row about the owner's session as an instruction it was
meant to act on.

The new file splits them. One short section addressed to the owner, carrying a
recommendation and no authority. One table addressed to the agent, covering delegated
work only and saying so.

Tell the owner the rule in one sentence when you apply it: they open whatever agent
they want, and no agent may change that or suggest changing it unless asked.

No project file changes.

---

## 2.2 (2026-09-15)

AGENTS.md gains a `## Commits` section. The structure check finds it, and the wording
comes from the template unchanged.

The default changed. Agents no longer commit at all; the owner reads the diff and
writes the history. A project whose AGENTS.md already grants commit permission keeps
that grant, and you ask the owner whether they still want it before touching the line.
Show them the old wording and the new default side by side.

The attribution rule inside that section is neither a setting nor a question. Apply it
whatever the owner chooses about committing.

Say this to the owner in plain words when you apply it: a coding agent's own harness
often instructs it to add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, which makes the model a visible
contributor on GitHub. This section overrides that instruction. Where earlier commits
already carry the trailer, offer to amend the recent ones, and tell them a force push
is needed for anything already pushed.

---

## 2.1 (2026-09-15)

The handoff files now stay out of the published repository by default. Copy
`templates/.gitignore.template` to the project root as `.gitignore` when the project
has none, and merge its entries when one exists. Ask the owner first, and tell them
what it costs: a collaborator cloning the remote receives no handoff files, and an
agent on another machine sees the current state only once file sync has finished.

Where the owner wants the repository to carry continuity for a team, uncomment the
four state files in that template and say so in the project's AGENTS.md Authority
section.

The startup reading target in the README moved from roughly 2,000 words to roughly
3,000. Nothing was cut to reach it. No project needs changing.

---

## 2.0 (2026-09-15)

Files to copy into the project if absent:

- `VOICE.md` at the project root. Ask the owner whether the shipped guide is theirs
  before leaving it in place.
- `project-context/LEARNING.md`
- `project-context/ORCHESTRATION.md`, replacing any 1.x copy. The 1.x version carried
  a Codex-only model table and no account of delegation cost.

Values the owner must choose, because no default is safe to assume:

- `Learning mode:` in AGENTS.md. Describe levels 0, 1 and 2 in one sentence each,
  then ask. The starter default is 2.
- Every line of the AGENTS.md Environment section. Ask; write "none" where the owner
  has no such access.

Do not backfill explainers for tasks completed before the upgrade. Offer
`/handoff explain <task-id>` for any single item the owner wants written up.

---

## 1.0 (2026-09-06)

First release. Four startup files, templates, ORCHESTRATION.md.
