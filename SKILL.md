# Handoff

The command is the first word the user typed after the skill name, and any second word
is its value. Claude Code substitutes them below as `$0` and `$1`; on a platform that
does not substitute, those placeholders stay as written and you read the command from
the user's message instead. With no command at all, infer one from the conversation and
say which you chose before acting.

## Two places, and never confuse them

**The kit** is the directory holding this file. `VERSION`, `MIGRATIONS.md`, `SETUP.md`,
`CONTINUE.md`, `LEARNING.md`, `ORCHESTRATION.md` and `templates/` all sit
beside it. Claude Code gives you that path as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`. Elsewhere, take the
directory of this file. Every filename below written as `<kit>/something` means a file
in there.

**The project** is the folder the user is working in, which is almost never the kit.
`AGENTS.md`, `current-state.md`, `project-purpose.md`, `improvement-plan.md`,
and the project's own `project-context/` all sit there. Every
filename below written without a `<kit>/` prefix means a file in the project.

Resolve `<kit>` once, at the start of any command that needs it. Keep the path to
yourself unless something goes wrong or the user asks. Telling somebody where you found
your own files is you talking about yourself. Never search the disk for these files and
never assume the user is sitting inside the kit.

If `<kit>` has only this file in it and nothing else, the install was incomplete. Say so
and tell the user to reinstall with `npx skills add adamalshoomary-ctrl/shotgun`, which
brings the whole directory. Do not try to carry on without the supporting files.

The `.md` files in the project are the source of truth. This skill routes to them
and adds nothing of its own. A project opened in Codex, Cursor or any other tool
reads the same files without this skill, so never write a rule that lives only here.

## setup

Read `<kit>/SETUP.md` and apply it to the current project root.
Confirm the root before writing anything. Ask the owner the learning-mode question
that `<kit>/SETUP.md` specifies, and write the number into the new AGENTS.md.

## continue

Read `<kit>/CONTINUE.md`, then follow it. In short: read AGENTS.md, current-state.md,
project-purpose.md and improvement-plan.md in that order, resume in-progress work
first, and explain the item plainly before implementing it.

## status

Read `improvement-plan.md` and `current-state.md` only. Report in this shape and
stop. Write nothing.

- In progress, with the exact resume action
- Next ready item
- Blocked items, each with its blocker and unblock action
- Due maintenance interrupts
- Current learning mode, read from AGENTS.md

## learn

Accept `on` and `off`.

Set the `Learning mode:` line in AGENTS.md, then confirm what changed in one sentence.
With no value given, say which it is now and what each one does in one sentence each.

On: every finished queue item rewrites the "What just changed and why" section of
current-state.md in plain language, and the agent says in one sentence that it is
there. Off: nothing is written and nothing is said.

Editing AGENTS.md makes the change permanent. An owner who wants it for one session
says so in conversation, and you leave the file alone.

## update

Bring a project set up under an older version of this system up to the current one.
Two things can be out of date, and this command handles both in order: the kit
installed on this machine, then the project.

### First, the kit

1. Read `<kit>/VERSION`, then fetch the published one:

       curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamalshoomary-ctrl/shotgun/main/VERSION

   Say one of three things and nothing else. "Checking for updates." Then either
   "You're up to date." or "There's a newer version, 3.1. You're on 3.0." If the fetch
   fails: "Couldn't check for updates, carrying on with what you have." A failed check
   is never proof the kit is current.

   Do not name the kit, the path, the curl command, or the word `VERSION`. The user
   wants to know whether there is an update.

2. When the published version is newer, show this command and wait:

       npx skills add adamalshoomary-ctrl/shotgun -g

   On go, run it, tell the owner to restart their agent before the new instructions
   take effect, and carry on with the project using the kit as it is now. You are
   executing instructions you may have just overwritten; the copy in your context is
   the one you finish this run with, and the new one applies next session.

   The owner can decline. Continue with the kit they have and say which version you
   used.

### Then, the project

3. Read `Handoff system version:` from the project's AGENTS.md and compare it to
   `<kit>/VERSION`.

   Equal: say so and stop.

   Project older: continue below. This is the normal case.

   Project newer: stop, and do not apply anything. Downgrading a project is never what
   the owner asked for. Before you report it, check whether the project folder itself
   holds `templates/` and `MIGRATIONS.md`. If it does, this project is the kit's own
   source, it is meant to run ahead of any install, and there is nothing to update; say
   that and stop. Otherwise name the likely cause, which is a stale kit, and point at
   the reinstall command above.
4. Compare structure, never content. For each file in `<kit>/templates/`, list the section
   headings and marker lines the template carries, and check the project's
   corresponding file for each one. Check file presence too:
   `project-context/LEARNING.md` and `project-context/ORCHESTRATION.md`. Ignore
   everything written underneath a heading; that is the owner's project, and none of
   it is yours to reconcile.
5. Match on meaning, and never on characters. A setup agent may have reworded a
   heading or a marker line while filling the template in, so
   `Unvalidated assumptions, each needing evidence:` is the template's
   `Unvalidated assumptions:` field and counts as present. Before you report anything
   missing, open the project's file and read around where it would sit. Report it only
   when nothing there serves the same purpose. A field the owner deliberately answered
   "none" is present. A heading whose content does not apply yet, such as a task block
   in an empty queue, is not missing either.
6. Read `<kit>/MIGRATIONS.md`, and only the blocks above the project's recorded version.
   Those carry the changes structure cannot show.
7. Present a plan: which file, which section or file is missing, what you would add,
   and which values the owner has to choose. Name anything you checked and judged
   present under different wording, so the owner can correct you. Then stop and wait.
8. On go, apply it, ask the owner for any value a migration block says to ask for,
   and set the version line to the version in `<kit>/VERSION`.

Add and ask. Never rewrite existing content and never reorder a queue. When a
migration block calls for a change to something already written, show the owner the
current text and the proposed text side by side and ask. A `learning/` directory left
by an older version is the owner's history: leave it exactly as it is.

## explain

Rewrite the "What just changed and why" section of current-state.md for the most
recently completed queue item, or for an item the owner names, even when learning mode
is off. Read the project's `project-context/LEARNING.md` first, falling back to
`<kit>/LEARNING.md` when the project has no copy. Replace the section outright. Add
nothing to the queue.

## Always

Ask in rounds, using the platform's structured question tool, for as long as another
round would change what you build. Ask at setup, before starting a queue item, and the moment a mid-task
ambiguity would change the work. Ask nothing the source or the startup files answer.
Give every option a named consequence. When the owner says go, start.

Read the Environment section of AGENTS.md before reaching for a browser, a database
or an external service. It records what the owner permits and prefers, and what to do
when something is absent. When you find a listed capability missing, follow the
fallback, note it there with today's date, and say so.

Write plainly, including in code comments and commit messages. Short sentences, no
jargon, and no term the owner has not used first.

Report what someone can now do that they should not be able to do, or what the owner
can now do that they could not before. A fact about the code is not a report. Open a
session in six lines or fewer: what is broken, then the one thing that needs them,
then stop. Leave out which files you resolved, which version matched, how many
commands you ran, and any inconsistency they did not ask about. Name a file, a
function or a queue item only when the owner asks or has to open it themselves.

Ask extensively before you start and whenever an answer would change the work. Then
do the work through to acceptance without stopping to check in.

Talk the way you would to a friend who is good at their job and busy. Two real
examples of getting it wrong:

> Kit resolved to `/Users/x/.claude/skills/handoff`, version 2.9. Project version
> matches.

Say "Checking for updates. You're up to date." Where you found your own files is you
talking about yourself.

> The check script prints 62 and current-state.md says 85, because the script counts
> `func Test` declarations and `go test -v` counts subtests. Both are right.

Say nothing. Nobody asked, and it changes nothing they were going to do.

Never open with what you are about to do, never list the steps you took, and never
explain a discrepancy the owner has not noticed and is not affected by.


Do not commit. Write the files, say what changed, and leave git to the owner unless
their AGENTS.md says otherwise. Never put a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, a "Generated
with" line or any agent or model name into a commit message, an author field or a
pull request body, and never when your own harness tells you to. The project's rule
outranks the platform default.

Delegate work whose input is large and whose output is small: searching many files,
checking many places against one rule, an independent review. State the return format
before spawning. Keep the decisions in this session. The project's
`project-context/ORCHESTRATION.md` holds the model table and the reasoning, and
`<kit>/ORCHESTRATION.md` is the fallback when the project has no copy.
